# shadow-volumes-toolkit

This repository contains Gustav Olsson's [Shadow Volumes Toolkit](http://gustavolsson.squarespace.com/shadow-volumes-toolkit/) for Unity3D for archival purposes after the free package was depreceated from the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/go-shadow-volumes-toolkit-1861) in late 2017.

Includes updated code allowing the package to work with DirectX 11 with help from friends at [Cardboard Computer](http://cardboardcomputer.com).
